This module adds the 'bind' method to all function objects, as inspired by this
blog post:

    http://alon.horev.net/blog/2013/10/20/argument-binding-in-python

This is meant as a pythonic replacement for functools.partial, and is used as
follows:

    >>> import bind                     
    >>> def subtract(a, b):             
    ...     return a - b                
    ...                                 
    >>> subtract5 = subtract.bind(b = 5)
    >>> subtract5(20)                   
    15                                  

This uses plenty of ctypes dickery, as provided by the forbiddenfruit module,
so use at your own risk. This also means it will only work with cpython, and is
basically a gigantic hack.
